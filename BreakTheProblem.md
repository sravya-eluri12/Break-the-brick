Breaking down the problem
1. Define the Problem
  State the goal clearly: What is the end result you want to achieve? For example, "Create a simple game where the player breaks bricks."
2. Identify Key Components
  List main features: Identify the primary features needed. For the Brick Breaker game, this could include:
  Paddle movement
  Ball movement and collision detection
  Brick layout and destruction
  Scoring system
  Game over conditions
3. Break Down Each Component
  Paddle Movement:

  Determine how the paddle will move (e.g., left and right based on keyboard input).
  Set boundaries to prevent the paddle from moving off-screen.
  Ball Movement:

  Decide how the ball moves (e.g., speed, direction).
  Implement collision detection with walls and the paddle.
  Brick Layout:

  Create a grid or array to represent the bricks.
  Define properties (e.g., whether a brick is broken).
  Scoring System:

  Decide how the score increases (e.g., points per brick broken).
  Display the score on the screen.
  Game Over Conditions:

  Define what causes the game to end (e.g., ball falling below the paddle).
  Create a mechanism to restart or quit the game.
4. Outline the Logic Flow
  Create a flowchart or outline: Visualize how each component interacts and the flow of the game. This might include:
  Start the game
  Display the paddle, ball, and bricks
  Check for user input
  Update positions and check for collisions
  Update score and check for game over
5. Consider Edge Cases
  Think about scenarios that could cause issues:
  What happens if the ball hits the corner of a brick?
  What if the paddle is at the edge when moving?
6. Write Pseudocode
  Draft pseudocode for each main component to clarify your thought process. 
7. Review and Adjust
  Review your breakdown to ensure all parts are covered.
  Adjust as needed based on complexity or additional requirements.
